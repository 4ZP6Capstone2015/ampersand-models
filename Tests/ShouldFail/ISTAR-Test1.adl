CONTEXT ISTAR_Test1
{- In a little project we had the same relation declaration repeated over different files.
   This was allowed in earlier versions.
   It worked for example in  "Ampersand v2.2.1.1074, build time: 16-Jun-13 10:37.17"

   In version "Prototype v2.2.1.2341, build time: 13-Mar-13 22:59.42 (lib: Ampersand v2.2.1.898, build time: 13-Mar-13 22:57.45)"
   and following, a relation may be declared only once.
   Sure enough, multiple population statements are allowed, also in different files.

--[The first file contained a relation declaration and a rule:]--

RULE "operational units": I[Unit] |- unitID;unitID~
unitID :: Unit * UnitID -- REF See http://nl.wikipedia.org

--[The second file repeated the declaration, but now with a population:]--

unitID :: Unit * UnitID -- REF http://nl.wikipedia.org (lijst is onvolledig en afko's kloppen niet per se)
