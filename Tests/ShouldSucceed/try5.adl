   Purpose: This is an attempt to mislead the type checker, by
            choosing a different source and target for t and u.
   Result: PASS
-- Reason: t/\u are in conflict (concepts B and E), but there is an intersection type (concept F, rule r1) to resolve that.
           Now s~ is in conflict with t/\u (A is not F), but there is an intersection type (concept D).
           The mischievous attempt to mislead the type checker is that it must derive that I[A]/\I[F]=I[D]

Proof:
   I[A]/\I[F]=I[D]
= {RULE r0}
   I[A]/\I[F]=(I[A]/\I[B])/\I[E]
= {RULE r1}
   I[A]/\(I[B]/\I[E])=(I[A]/\I[B])/\I[E]
= {/\ is associative}
   True
