{-
   Purpose: This is an attempt to mislead the type checker, by
            choosing a different source and target for t and u.
   Result: PASS
-- Reason: cod s and dom(t\/u) are in conflict (concepts B and E), but rule r1 provides an intersection type (concept F) to resolve that.
           now s~ is in conflict with t\/u (A is not F). However, it can be proven that I[A]\/I[F]=I[D],
           so the type checker must conclude that cod s and dom(t\/u) can be matched in concept D.
           The "mischief" is in the attempt to refer to F indirectly.

Proof:
   I[A]\/I[F]=I[D]
= {RULE r0}
   I[A]\/I[F]=(I[A]\/I[B])\/I[E]
= {RULE r1}
   I[A]\/(I[B]\/I[E])=(I[A]\/I[B])\/I[E]
= {\/ is associative}
   True
