The purpose of this application is to get an idea whether or not,
(and if so, how,) the DEMO method of Jan Dietz and the Ampersand method
overlap or complement one another.

In order to do this, we have created an Ampersand application
based on the EU-Rent example given in "DEMO-3 Way of Working.pdf" 
(this is in the directory "DEMO (Jan Dietz)", which also contains
some notational stuff and a link to the DEMO website.)

The Ampersand application is found in "EURent.adl" and the files
that are referred to there.

Currently, the application is starting to work, provided it is
compiled with "Prototype v3.0.1.2964" and the latest static files
that you should obtain straigth from the repository.
